# **3D Tetris game**

#### This project is an implementation of the classic Tetris game, brought into a 3D environment using OpenGL and C++. It features custom GLSL shaders that handle texturing, lighting, and shading, as well as real-time rendering and keyboard-based user interaction. The game showcases essential elements of a graphics pipeline while maintaining the original mechanics of Tetris in 3D space.
